			After working several jobs in the transport and logistics industry, I
			realized I wanted to work somewhere a bit more mentally stimulating.
			Something that allowed creativity as well as critical thinking and problem
			solving. After reading a post on Reddit about someone becoming a
			self-taught developer, I suddenly remembered that in my teenage years I
			used to make small websites for fun and I really enjoyed doing that. And
			so after doing a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that I really
			wanted to become a front end developer. I love working with React
			especially. Learning new languages or frameworks is something I really
			enjoy. I finally found my true passion; making beautiful interactive,
			animated, responsive websites.
